- 👋 Hi, I’m @EmpireJack
- 👀 I’m curious by nature, and interested in technology, although I don't work in tech
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, and also have some basic knowledge of C++, Javascript, HTML, CSS
- 💞️ I’m not particularly looking to collaborate on anything at the moment, but will advertise if that changes
- 📫 How to reach me ? I DON'T REALLY WANT TO BE REACHED :-) 🦖
